Scientific reasoning - hypotes->experiment->conclusion

Technical knowledge - To know how a machine works
Engineering knowledge - To be able to construct new machines
Scientific knowledge - To understand the principles behind machines and their
limitations

Engineering - We find solutions to certain classes of problems
Science - We find theorems and general laws that apply to a large class of
situations

# Science
Generalization - abstraction, remove variables
Verification & validation
Methodology

# Goals of Science
- Science is a way to find absolute truths about nature
- Science is a tool for handling nature in an efficient way

Instrumentalism = Truth is not important, effectiveness is

# HD-method
Have hypothesis, want to prove false. Observations E_i such that H -> !E_i then
E_i falsifies H.

Add A paradigm to falsify H

# Falisficationism
A theory should be alble to falsify, theory T consequence K of T, if !K then T
falsified and must be rejected. Only falsifiable theories is considered
scientific.

A falsified theory cannot predict anything.

# Scientific method
Normatively - how science should be practised.
Descriptively - how science is done in practice.

# Rosenthal experiment
Test intelligence mice, group A told smarter, group A got better results.
Expectations and influence matters -> double blind tests.

# Intelligent design
The world is to complex to be considered happening at random. Something else did
the design.

# The Monkey Trail
Teaching the evolution

# Scientific Theory
Define: guided and explained by natural law, testable in empirical world,
conclusions not final, falsifiable.

# Correspondence Truth
Evidence in reality.

# Coherence Truth
Consistent system of statements without contradictions. Prove using logic.

# Intuitive Truth
We cannot believe cannot be false.

# Pragmatic Truth
Can't prove false/true but believe it is true since good consequences for us

# Logical positivism
S = stmt
if S can be proven true/false
or observations can indicate true/false
everything else is meaningless

# Induction
Make observations and find pattern
If observations agree theory holds

# Principle of uniformity in nature PUN
Regularities in nature, meaningful to use induction

# Goodman's paradox
Grue = green if observed before to or blue and not observed before t. Are all
emeralds green or grue? Should be green but induction says grue.

# Occam's razor
Simplicity

Can't formalize common sense

# Kuhn's paradigm
background knowledge

# Ad hoc hypothesis
An hypothesis tailor-made to prove or disprove H

# Bayesian probability
The probability that A happens given that B has happened, P(A|B)
Strengthen = P(H|E) > P(H) and viseversa

# Probability:
Axiomatic: A set of elementary events, every other element is a combination of these events
Frequency: Probability is roughly frequency from repeated experiments
Subjective: A probability someone believes it to be

# DN model
Hempel, nomological refers scientific law (L), fact P, situation S, L -> P,
init. cond. I applies in S, Conclusion: P must be observed, I causes P

# Causes
Sufficient cause: A is a sufficient cause of B if A->B
Necessary cause: A is a necessary cause of B if not A -> not B(B->A)

# explanation
Causal explanation: If something causes P, the it also explains P. (phy, bio,
ss, math,cs) Functional explanation: P has some good function and this fact
explains P. (ss)
Explanation by purpose: There is some mind that has wanted P. (ss)
Pragmatic explanation: The explanation is adapted to the type of answer the
questioner wants. (ss)

# Statistical correlations
P(A&B)>P(A)P(B) A and B positively correlated
Reichenbach P(A&)=P(A)P(B) no one is the cause of the other

# Rationality
In this context rationality means that each person acts in order to maximize his
or hers utility.  This model is used in Game Theory.

# Paradigm Shift
A paradigm consists of terms, methods, norms and ways of viewing thing. It
defines our way of understanding the world (or at least a part of it).

Normal science is science as it is done within the paradigm.

In revolutionary science we reject the old paradigm and replaces it with a new
one.

# Paradox
PREMISE consisting of facts and established truths.
ARGUMENT which is a logical derivation from the premise.
CONCLUSION which seems to be false.
In every paradox, either the premise is wrong, the argument is flawed or the
conclusion is in fact true.

\# Arisotle: descriptions of causes in nature: material, efficient, formal,
final, Euclid: formal mathematics, axioms geometry, Brahe: planets move in
ellipses.

\# Attitude: Communalism: knowledge should be accessible for all people,
Universalism: everyone should have the right to contribute, Disinterestedness:
science should be objective and not ruled by special interests, Originality: the
results should be new, Skepticism: scientists should be open to criticism

\# Research: Exploratory: research on a new problem about which little is known,
Testing-out: find limits of previous generalization, apply in new context,
Problem-solving: start with existing problem find solution

\# Scientific Filter: put solution in wider context, reference similar work,
follow standards, prove

\# Scientific method: Analysis, Hypothesis, Synthesis, Validation

\# Vocabularies: deductive system the syntax of the language.

\# Proof Methodology: learn by imitate existing proofs

\# Counterexamples: Global: statement in theorem is false, Local: step in proof
incorrect

\# Paradoxes: Russel: Russell's paradox is based on examples like this: Consider
a group of barbers who shave only those men who do not shave themselves. Suppose
there is a barber in this collection who does not shave himself; then by the
definition of the collection, he must shave himself. But no barber in the
collection can shave himself. (If so, he would be a man who does shave men who
shave themselves

\# GÃ¶del: a system must contain sentences which cannot be proved or disproved
inside the system

\# Tarski: snow is white iff snow is white

\# Data: Primary: measurements or observations, Secondary: processed primary
books and articles, Quantitative: raw numbers, Qualitative: GUI, opinions,
stories

\# Data analysis: Content: frequency, Mining: patterns in big data, Meta:
analysis of analyzes
